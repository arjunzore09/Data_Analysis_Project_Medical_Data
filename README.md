# Medical-Data-Analytics
## Aim
To analyze Electronic Health Records (EHR) using data analytics  techniques in order to identify patterns and trends in patient readmission  rates."
## Objective
1. To collect and preprocess electronic health records (EHR) data for
analysis.
2. To identify key features influencing patient readmission.
3. To apply statistical and machine learning techniques to predict the
likelihood of readmission.
4. To visualize patterns and trends in readmission using data visualization
tools.
5. To provide data-driven recommendations for reducing readmission rates.
## Tools/Software used
- FOR DATA RETRIEVAL: MYSQL COMMUNITY SERVER & MYSQL WORKBENCH
- FOR DATA IMPORT & EXPORT: EXCEL
- FOR DATA VISUALIZATION: POWERBI
